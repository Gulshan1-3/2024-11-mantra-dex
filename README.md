**Note re: risk level upgrades/downgrades**

Two important notes about judging phase risk adjustments: 
- High- or Medium-risk submissions downgraded to Low-risk (QA)) will be ineligible for awards.
- Upgrading a Low-risk finding from a QA report to a Medium- or High-risk finding is not supported.

As such, wardens are encouraged to select the appropriate risk level carefully during the submission phase.

## Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues


_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._


- **[Pool Manager]** - Since the pool creation and the initial liquidity provision are two separate actions, an attacker might attempt to front-run the first liquidity provider in order to set an unfavorable price and take advantage of immediate arbitrage. This is handled by multiple messages being passed in the same tx. If a user creating a pool is concerned by front-running then they should send create and provide liquidity messages in the same transaction. We will consider adding this functionality in the contract in the future.

- **[Farm Manager]** - Since the number of farms that can be created for a given LP denom is limited, the farm creation can be blocked if an attacker creates the maximum allowed number, preventing legitimate farm creators from creating meaningful farms. This is not a concern since the farm creation fee is set relatively high, making it unfeasible for someone to perform such an attack. Additionally, the contract owner has the ability to close spam farms if necessary.

- **[Farm Manager]** - Minimal farm assets amount does not respect different
currencies. The MIN_FARM_AMOUNT constant does not take into account different coins with varying monetary value, despite farms can use different denominations for rewards. The constant was essentially chosen to prevent creating farms with dust rewards. However, considering the farm creation fee is relatively high, that issue is mitigated. To make the MIN_FARM_AMOUNT value dynamic a solution involving oracles must be adopted, which is not in place at the moment.

- **[Farm Manager]** - Magic numbers used when calculating weights. These numbers were calculated using a polynomial. Will potentially be cleaned up in a future iteration. 

- **[Farm Manager]** - Users can potentially lose farm rewards if they don't claim before the farm expires. The farm expires at least 1 month after the reward distribution finishes. 

- **[Epoch Manager]** - The contract owner can alter the epoch configuration, which could change the epoch values derived by the contract when querying the current epoch value, which is used when calculating farm rewards. Although this is possible, it is not intended to happen once the contract is instantiated and the genesis epoch starts.

- **[Fee Collector]** - The fee collector contract doesn't have any functionality as of yet besides collecting fees generated by the protocol. The contract will be migrated once there's a use for those fees.

- Overflow checks not enabled for release profile for individual contracts. It is however enabled at workspace level.

# Additional context

## Main invariants

Main invariants:

- Genesis epoch and epoch duration, not intended to changed once set up.
- Pool fees to remain immutable once the pool is created.
- Pool asset decimals to remain immutable once the pool is created.
- Pool and Farm creation fee will always be a meaningful value, never set to zero.
- The number of farms for a given LP denom is constant. 
- The number of active and closed farm positions a user can have at any given time is finite.


## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
Areas of concern:

On the Pool Manager:
- Pool swaps and fees calculations with single and multihop operations.
- Pool LP calculations.
- Internal pool bookkeeping. Since the pool manager holds multiple pools, there's an internal pool ledger keeping track of what assets are in which pool. It is critical the balances are updated accurately liquidity is added/removed from pools.
- Is it possible to extract value while creating pools by not paying the right fees, i.e. pool creation fee + token factory fee?
- Potential flaw providing liquidity with a single asset?

On the Farm Manager:
- Farm reward calculation/claim logic.
- Is it possible to maliciously extract funds from the farm manager?
- Can people be locked from claiming pending rewards?
- Can an attacker exploit creating farm positions on behalf of someone else via the pool manager?
- Emergency penalty fee calculation and distribution among farm owners.

Overall:

- Pay attention to the code flows and try finding any flaws in the logic that could lead to unexpected behaviors or vulnerabilities in the contracts.
- Approximation errors when handling very large amounts, especially with assets having 18 decimal places. Think of handling trillions of such assets.



## All trusted roles in the protocol

While the protocol is permissionless, there are a few roles:

- Contract owner: The only role that can update the existing configuration of the contract. This applies to all the contracts.
- Farm owner: The owner of the farm. This role can at any point close the farm. This can also be done by the contract owner of the farm manager contract. Unclaimed funds are sent back to the farm owner.

## Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts:

Standard xyk AMM model for constant product pools. 
The curve model for stable pools with 32 Newton iterations instead of 256.


## Running tests


```bash
git clone --recurse https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-mantra-dex.git
cd 2024-11-mantra-dex
cargo build
cargo test
# If you don´t have `just`: `cargo install just` before proceeding
just optimize 
```
